## Abstract

Standard endurance fueling guidelines recommend 60-90g carbohydrates per hour for events lasting over 2.5 hours (Jeukendrup, 2014). This recommendation, while well-supported for events of 2-5 hours at moderate-to-high intensity, does not account for the metabolic realities of ultra-distance gravel racing where events routinely last 8-20+ hours at sub-threshold intensity. This paper synthesizes current exercise physiology research to propose a **duration-scaled carbohydrate intake framework** that adjusts fueling recommendations based on estimated race duration, intensity-dependent fuel utilization, and gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance constraints. The framework is implemented in the Gravel God Race Prep Kit generator, providing personalized fueling targets for 328 gravel race profiles.

## 1. The Problem: One Size Does Not Fit All

The prevailing recommendation for carbohydrate intake during endurance exercise -- 60-90g/hr using multiple transportable carbohydrates -- originates from controlled laboratory studies conducted primarily at moderate-to-high intensities (65-75% VO2max) for durations of 2-3 hours (Jeukendrup, 2014). These studies established the physiological basis for dual-transport carbohydrate delivery (glucose via SGLT1 + fructose via GLUT5) and demonstrated clear performance benefits.

However, gravel racing presents a fundamentally different metabolic environment:

- **Duration range**: 3 hours (50-mile events) to 20+ hours (200+ mile events)
- **Intensity range**: 40-75% VO2max depending on distance and athlete
- **GI stress**: Vibration, rough terrain, limited access to toilets
- **Self-sufficiency**: Many events have minimal or no aid stations
- **Pacing variability**: Terrain-forced intensity fluctuations unlike flat road cycling

A back-of-pack rider at the Unbound 200 (finishing in ~18-20 hours at ~100-130W) faces a categorically different fueling challenge than a front-of-pack rider finishing in ~10 hours at ~250W. Applying the same 60-90g/hr recommendation to both athletes ignores the underlying physiology.

## 2. Key Physiological Mechanisms

### 2.1 Carbohydrate Absorption: The Transporter Ceiling

Intestinal carbohydrate absorption is limited by the capacity of specific transport proteins:

| Transporter | Substrate | Max Rate | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| SGLT1 | Glucose, maltodextrin | ~60g/hr (1.0 g/min) | Small intestine |
| GLUT5 | Fructose | ~30-40g/hr | Small intestine |
| Combined (dual-transport) | Glucose + Fructose (2:1) | ~90g/hr | Both transporters |
| Combined (near 1:1 ratio) | Glucose + Fructose (1:0.8) | ~108-120g/hr | Emerging research |

**Oxidation efficiency decreases at higher intake rates:**
- At 90g/hr: ~86% of ingested carbs are oxidized
- At 120g/hr: ~75% are oxidized -- the remaining 25% accumulates in the GI tract, increasing distress risk (EndureIQ, 2024)

**Gut training can improve absorption:**
- SGLT1 transporter density can double within 2 weeks of increased dietary carbohydrate (GSSI)
- Full gut training adaptation requires 6-10 weeks
- Gut training reduces GI symptoms by 26-47% and improves carbohydrate absorption by 45-54%
- Athletes unaccustomed to eating during exercise have 2x the risk of GI symptoms

### 2.2 Fuel Utilization Scales with Intensity

The substrate utilization data from van Loon et al. (2001) demonstrates a critical relationship between exercise intensity and carbohydrate oxidation:

| Intensity (% VO2max) | CHO Oxidation (g/hr) | Fat Oxidation (g/hr) | CHO % of Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~44% (easy endurance) | 86 | 41 | ~68% |
| ~57% (moderate endurance) | 122 | 47 | ~72% |
| ~72% (threshold/race pace) | 235 | 31 | ~88% |

At ~44% VO2max -- the approximate intensity of a recreational cyclist riding Unbound at 10 mph -- total carbohydrate oxidation is only 86g/hr, and a significant portion of that comes from endogenous glycogen, not exogenous (ingested) intake. Exogenous carbohydrate oxidation represents roughly 60-75% of ingested carbs. Pushing 90g/hr of exogenous carbs into this metabolic environment exceeds the body's capacity to use them.

### 2.3 The Reverse Crossover Point

In events lasting beyond 6-8 hours, a time-dependent metabolic shift occurs regardless of intensity:

- Fat contribution to total energy expenditure rises from ~30% in hour 1 to ~77% by hours 7-8 (Frontiers in Nutrition, 2025)
- This "reverse crossover point" reflects progressive glycogen depletion and upregulation of fat oxidation pathways
- As fat becomes the dominant fuel, the marginal benefit of additional exogenous carbohydrate diminishes
- The practical implication: at 16+ hours, carbohydrate's primary role shifts from bulk energy provision to **maintaining blood glucose and cognitive function**

### 2.4 GI Distress Escalates with Duration

GI distress is not merely uncomfortable -- it is a primary cause of DNF and performance degradation in ultra-endurance events:

| Event Duration | Severe GI Distress Prevalence |
|---|---|
| Marathon / cycling (2-5 hours) | ~4% |
| Ironman (8-17 hours) | ~32% |
| Ultra-marathon (16+ hours) | 85-96% (any symptom) |

Contributing factors in long-duration events:
- **Splanchnic blood flow reduces up to 80%** during exercise (redirected to working muscles)
- Solution osmolality >500 mOsm/L increases GI risk
- Drink concentration >7% (7g/100ml) increases risk
- 7% of long-distance triathletes DNF specifically due to GI problems
- 43% of ultra-endurance athletes report "serious" GI problems

## 3. The Duration-Scaled Framework

Based on the evidence above, we propose the following framework that adjusts carbohydrate intake targets based on estimated race duration:

| Estimated Duration | Carb Target (g/hr) | Rationale | Typical Gravel Event |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2-4 hours | 80-100 | High-intensity race pace. Standard dual-transport range. High CHO oxidation at 65-80% VO2max. | 50-mile races, fast 100-milers |
| 4-8 hours | 60-80 | Endurance pace. Classic Jeukendrup recommendation. Well-validated range. | Standard 100-mile races |
| 8-12 hours | 50-70 | Sub-threshold intensity. Fat oxidation increasing. GI risk climbing. | Mid-pack 150-milers, back-pack 100-milers |
| 12-16 hours | 40-60 | Ultra pace. Reverse crossover in effect. Fat is primary fuel. | 200-mile races, back-pack 150-milers |
| 16+ hours | 30-50 | Survival pace. GI distress prevalence >80%. Appetite suppression common. Palatability and tolerance are the limiters. | Back-pack 200-mile races |

### 3.1 Key Principles

1. **Carbs fuel the work, fat fuels the time.** At high intensity, carbohydrate is the limiting substrate. At low intensity over long duration, fat oxidation carries the metabolic load and carbohydrate's role is to maintain blood glucose and cognitive function.

2. **The ceiling is physiological, not aspirational.** At sub-threshold intensity, total carbohydrate oxidation may be only 86g/hr (van Loon et al.), of which perhaps 50-65g can come from exogenous sources. Ingesting 90g/hr in this scenario doesn't improve performance -- it overwhelms the gut.

3. **GI tolerance is the practical limiter in ultra events.** With 85-96% of ultra athletes experiencing GI symptoms and splanchnic blood flow reduced by 80%, the question shifts from "how much can I absorb?" to "how much can I tolerate?"

4. **Palatability matters more as duration increases.** In events over 12 hours, athletes frequently lose appetite for sweet foods. Mixed macronutrient intake (including some protein and fat) becomes practical and potentially beneficial for maintaining compliance.

5. **Train the gut, but respect the ceiling.** Gut training (6-10 weeks) can meaningfully increase absorption and reduce symptoms, but it does not change the fundamental relationship between intensity and fuel utilization.

### 3.2 Speed Estimation for Gravel

Average gravel speeds are significantly lower than road cycling due to surface resistance, terrain variability, and mechanical issues. Our estimates (conservative, including stops):

| Distance | Estimated Average Speed | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| <= 50 miles | 14 mph | Short enough for sustained tempo; less mechanical risk |
| 51-100 miles | 12 mph | Standard gravel endurance pace |
| 101-150 miles | 11 mph | Fatigue accumulation, more stops, rougher pacing |
| 150+ miles | 10 mph | Ultra-distance reality; includes significant stop time |

These are mid-pack estimates. Front-of-pack riders will be significantly faster (and thus in a shorter-duration, higher-intensity fueling bracket), while back-of-pack riders may be even slower. The framework is intentionally conservative -- it's better to slightly over-fuel than to bonk.

## 4. Practical Application

### 4.1 Example: Unbound 200 (200 miles)

**Estimated pace:** 10 mph = 20 hours on course

**Duration bracket:** 16+ hours (Survival pace)

**Carb target:** 30-50g/hr = 600-1,000g total

**In practice:** 24-40 gels equivalent (but athletes should mix formats -- liquid carbs, real food, gels -- to maintain palatability over 20 hours)

**Comparison to flat 60-90g/hr:** That would yield 1,200-1,800g total, which:
- Exceeds total carbohydrate oxidation at this intensity (~86g/hr including endogenous)
- Virtually guarantees GI distress at this duration (85-96% prevalence)
- Does not account for the 77% fat contribution to energy by hours 7-8

### 4.2 Example: Mid-South 100 (100 miles)

**Estimated pace:** 12 mph = ~8.3 hours

**Duration bracket:** 8-12 hours (Sub-threshold)

**Carb target:** 50-70g/hr = 415-581g total

**In practice:** 17-23 gels equivalent, supplemented with on-course aid at miles ~30 and ~60

### 4.3 Example: SBT GRVL Blue Course (40 miles)

**Estimated pace:** 14 mph = ~2.9 hours

**Duration bracket:** 2-4 hours (High-intensity race pace)

**Carb target:** 80-100g/hr = 229-286g total

**In practice:** Standard high-carb race strategy. Dual-transport gels/drink mix. 9-11 gels equivalent. Intensity is high enough that carbohydrate is the dominant fuel and the body can process it.

## 5. Implementation

### 5.1 Gravel God Prep Kit Integration

The duration-scaled framework is implemented in `compute_fueling_estimate()` in the Race Prep Kit generator (`wordpress/generate_prep_kit.py`). For each of the 328 race profiles:

1. Race distance (miles) is extracted from the race profile
2. Average speed is estimated based on distance bracket
3. Duration is calculated
4. Carb rate range is selected from the duration-scaled table
5. Total carb needs and gel equivalents are computed
6. A contextual note explains the physiological reasoning

This produces personalized fueling callouts that differ meaningfully across the race database -- a 50-mile race gets 80-100g/hr, while a 200-mile race gets 30-50g/hr.

### 5.2 Coaching Pipeline Integration

For the Athlete Custom Training Plan Pipeline, the duration-scaled framework should inform:

- **Gut training periodization:** Longer target races need earlier gut training initiation (10+ weeks out)
- **Practice fueling during long rides:** Train at the target carb rate, not a generic one
- **Race-day nutrition plans:** Build calorie targets around the duration bracket, not a flat g/hr
- **Food selection:** Ultra events (12+ hours) should plan for savory/mixed-macro foods, not just gels

### 5.3 Limitations

- Speed estimates are population averages; individual variation is significant
- No body weight or power input -- these would improve precision significantly
- The framework assumes mid-pack performance; front-of-pack and back-of-pack athletes should adjust
- Altitude, heat, and other environmental factors affect both intensity and GI tolerance
- Individual GI tolerance varies enormously; these are starting targets, not prescriptions

## 6. Future Work

### 6.1 Personalized Calculator with Biometric Input

An email-gated calculator accepting body weight, FTP, and target pace would produce significantly more accurate estimates. The power-based formula from IronmanHacks:

```
Carb Intake (g/h) = Body Weight (kg) * 0.7 * (Power Output (watts) / 100) * 0.7
```

Example: 75kg rider at 150W = 55g/hr; same rider at 250W = 92g/hr.

This inherently scales with intensity and body size, making it more precise than distance-only estimation.

### 6.2 Integration with Training Plan Fueling Periodization

Race-day fueling is the endpoint of a training nutrition strategy. The gut training protocol (from Gravel God Guide Chapter 5) should be parameterized by the target race's duration bracket:

| Race Duration Bracket | Gut Training Start | Target Practice Rate | Sessions/Week |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2-4 hours | 6 weeks out | 80-100g/hr | 2 |
| 4-8 hours | 8 weeks out | 60-80g/hr | 2-3 |
| 8-12 hours | 10 weeks out | 50-70g/hr | 2 (long rides) |
| 12+ hours | 10-12 weeks out | 40-60g/hr + real food | 1-2 (longest rides) |

### 6.3 Hydration and Sodium Integration

This paper focuses on carbohydrate, but a complete fueling framework would integrate:
- Sweat rate estimation (ml/hr by temperature and intensity)
- Sodium replacement (Precision Hydration's sweat composition testing)
- Solution osmolality management (keeping drinks <7% concentration)
