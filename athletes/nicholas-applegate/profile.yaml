  experience: I like flexibility / adaptability. I like to understand how what I'm doing will affect my goals / plan (so I
    can use that motivation while executing a given workout)

  anything_else: |-
    I want to work in more base... I think that's what I had first 2x times doing unbound from all the road racing I was doing in those seasons. Last time I tried to train for unbound 200 specifically with a lot of sweet spot but that doesn't seem to build the durability I need for unbound. I'm will to put in up to 2hrs of trainer time on weeknights if it helps my base.
    I also want to ramp quickly to some 8+ hrs zone 2 rides and slowly work in intensity at the beginning / end as I dial my base and nutrition.
