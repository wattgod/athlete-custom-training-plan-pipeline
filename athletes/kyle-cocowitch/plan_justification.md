## 1. Athlete Profile Summary

| Factor | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Age | 28 | Young, high recovery capacity |
| Current FTP | Unknown | Week 1 FTP test critical |
| Weight | Unknown | Need to establish baseline |
| Weekly Hours Available | 5-10 hours | G SPOT methodology ideal |
| Training Background | Ironman 70.3 (2025) | Strong endurance base, structured training experience |
| Injury History | Meniscus scope 12/3/25 | Avoid deep squatting, otherwise fully recovered |

## 2. Questionnaire-to-Plan Mapping

### Schedule & Availability

| Questionnaire Input | Plan Decision |
|---------------------|---------------|
| "5-10 hours/week" | 7 hours cycling target, FINISHER tier |
| "Sky is the limit" availability | Full 7-day training schedule utilized |
| Saturday preferred long day | Long rides on Saturday |
| Sunday preferred off day | Sunday = easier endurance/recovery |
| "6:30 AM - 9:30 PM" available | Maximum flexibility - any time slot works |
| Full-time work (30-40 hrs) | Weekday sessions fit around work |

### Methodology Selection: G SPOT / Threshold

| Questionnaire Input | Why G SPOT Selected |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 7 hours/week target | Falls in G SPOT sweet zone (7-10h) |
| "Not as scientific with training" | G SPOT is approachable, clear zones |
| "Appreciate structure and guidance" | Well-defined interval targets |
| Ironman 70.3 background | Can handle threshold efforts |
| Goal: "increase FTP by 15%" | G SPOT directly targets FTP improvement |
| No strong methodology preference (all 3s) | G SPOT is balanced, beginner-friendly |

**Intensity Distribution:**
- Z1-Z2 (Easy): 50%
- Z3 (Tempo/G SPOT): 35%
- Z4-Z5 (Threshold+): 15%

**Key Workouts:**
- Sweet spot intervals (88-94% FTP)
- Over-unders (threshold stress)
- Tempo blocks (sustained power)

### Race-Specific Preparation

| Race Demand | How Plan Addresses It |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 73 miles / 4.5 hours | Long rides build to 3.5+ hours |
| 5,500ft elevation gain | Over-unders, sustained climbing efforts |
| Altitude (6,732ft) | Heat acclimation protocol weeks 12-16 |
| Gravel handling | Skills focus in long ride descriptions |
| Fueling for 4+ hours | Fueling practice built into long rides |

### Health & Injury Considerations

| Health Factor | Plan Accommodation |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Meniscus surgery (12/3/25) | No deep squatting in strength workouts |
| "Recovering very well" | Full training load appropriate |
| 28 years old | High volume tolerance, fast recovery |
| 8+ hours sleep | Excellent recovery capacity |
| Low stress | Can handle harder training blocks |

### Equipment & Environment

| Input | Plan Usage |
|-------|------------|
| Smart trainer + power meter | All workouts have precise power targets |
| Full gym access | Strength sessions use full equipment (avoiding deep squats) |
| "Live in Denver, have trainer" | Indoor/outdoor flexibility |
| Strava primary platform | ZWO files work with Strava-connected devices |
| HR monitor + GPS | Backup zones available |

### Self-Identified Weaknesses

| Weakness Stated | How Plan Addresses It |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Time on bike outside" | Long rides emphasize outdoor execution |
| "Pedal and body efficiency" | Cadence drills, form focus in workouts |
| "Knowing when to push and chill" | RPE guidance, pacing practice |
| "Still need lots of hours in saddle" | Progressive volume increase through Build phase |

---

## 3. Phase Structure Justification

| Phase | Weeks | Why This Duration |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| BASE | 1-9 | 9 weeks to rebuild from off-season; Ironman fitness has faded |
| BUILD | 10-14 | 5 weeks race-specific G SPOT/Threshold work |
| PEAK | 15 | 1 week maximum load |
| TAPER | 16-18 | 3 weeks - longer taper due to higher training load than Benjy |
| RACE | 19 | Race week - openers only |

**No Maintenance Phase:** Kyle has no June work constraints like Benjy. Full progression through race week.

---

## 4. Weekly Structure Justification

| Day | Workout Type | Why |
|-----|--------------|-----|
| Monday | Endurance | Start week with aerobic work |
| Tuesday | G SPOT/Threshold | Key intensity session |
| Wednesday | Recovery/Strength | Mid-week recovery + strength |
| Thursday | FTP Test (W1) / Threshold | Second intensity session |
| Friday | Endurance | Pre-weekend easy |
| Saturday | Long Ride | Key day - maximum availability |
| Sunday | Endurance | Easier day per preference |

**Strength:** Wednesday + Thursday (2x/week)
- Foundation, Power Development, Cycling-Specific rotation
- NO DEEP SQUATTING due to meniscus surgery
- Uses full gym equipment available

## 5. Anticipated Questions

### "Why G SPOT instead of something more intense?"

Your questionnaire showed no strong preference for any methodology (all 3s). G SPOT is the best "default" for your situation:
- 7 hours/week is perfect for G SPOT
- Your goal of "15% FTP increase" is exactly what G SPOT targets
- You're new to cycling-specific structured training (Ironman was triathlon)
- It's sustainable and reduces injury risk post-surgery

### "I did Ironman 70.3 - why am I in FINISHER tier, not COMPETE?"

Tier is based on weekly hours, not past accomplishments. At 5-10 hours/week cycling-only, FINISHER tier is appropriate. Your Ironman was 9 workouts across 3 sports. This plan is cycling-focused within your stated availability.

### "Can I do more volume?"

Yes, but let's see how you respond first. Your meniscus is recently healed, and you've been in off-season. We'll reassess after Week 4. If recovery is excellent and you want more, we can add.

### "Why is there no deep squatting in strength workouts?"

You stated: "Meniscus scope on 12/3/25 - recovering very well, no current limitations now outside of unnecessary deep squatting." We're respecting that. All leg exercises use partial range or alternative movements.

### "How is my plan different from Benjy's?"

| Factor | Kyle | Benjy |
|--------|------|-------|
| Methodology | G SPOT | HIIT-Focused |
| Weekly Hours | 7 hours | 5 hours |
| Tier | FINISHER | AYAHUASCA |
| Phase Structure | Full 19-week | Front-loaded (June constraint) |
| Intensity Split | 50/35/15 | 30/20/50 |

You have more time and fewer constraints, so your plan has more volume and moderate intensity. Benjy is time-crunched and needs maximal intensity per hour.

### "I want to train with Benjy and Burk - can we do the same workouts?"

Some workouts will overlap (long rides, recovery days), but your key sessions differ by methodology. Coordinate long ride days (Saturdays) for group riding. Key intensity sessions should be done to YOUR prescription.

## 6. Success Metrics

By race day, you should:
- [ ] Have a tested FTP (not unknown)
- [ ] Show 10-15% FTP improvement from baseline
- [ ] Complete 3.5+ hour rides without bonking
- [ ] Execute race-pace fueling without GI issues
- [ ] Feel confident on gravel descents
- [ ] Arrive rested, excited, and ready to have fun

## 7. Risk Factors & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Meniscus re-aggravation | No deep squats; monitor for knee pain |
| Too much trainer, not enough road | Long rides emphasize outdoor execution |
| FTP unknown - zones may be wrong | Week 1 FTP test; retest at Week 9 |
| Pacing inexperience | RPE guidance in every workout; race sim sessions |
| Over-eager volume increase | Structured progression; check-ins at Week 4 |
