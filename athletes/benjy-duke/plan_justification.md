## 1. Athlete Profile Summary

| Factor | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Age | 39 | Masters-age recovery considerations |
| Current FTP | 180W (estimated) | Needs testing - Week 1 FTP test |
| Weight | 75kg | 2.4 W/kg - room for improvement |
| Weekly Hours Available | 5 cycling + 2 strength | Time-crunched approach required |
| Training Background | 20+ years MTB, new to structured | Strong aerobic base, needs cycling specificity |
| Injury History | L4/L5 herniation (2019, recovered) | Mobility/stretching non-negotiable |

## 2. Questionnaire-to-Plan Mapping

### Schedule Constraints

| Questionnaire Input | Plan Decision |
|---------------------|---------------|
| "3-4 biking days per week" | 6 cycling sessions/week designed, but recovery alternatives built in |
| "Monday = rest day, family time" | Monday programmed as Rest with recovery instructions |
| "Weekday max 60 min" | Tue-Fri sessions capped at 60 min; intensity used instead of volume |
| "Saturday/Sunday available 300 min" | Long rides and key sessions placed on weekends |
| "Job in June prevents extensive training" | Peak training completes by June 1; Weeks 16-17 are Maintenance; Week 18-19 Taper |

### Methodology Selection

| Questionnaire Input | Why HIIT-Focused Selected |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| time_crunched: 5 (highest preference) | HIIT maximizes adaptation per hour |
| hiit_focused: 4 | Strong explicit preference |
| 5 hours/week cycling | Falls in HIIT sweet spot (4-6h) |
| "Want results with limited time" | HIIT delivers most TSS impact per minute |
| years_structured: 0 | WARNING: New to intervals - progression starts conservative |

**Why NOT other methodologies:**
- **Polarized (80/20)**: Requires 8+ hours to get enough Z2 volume
- **High Volume**: Explicitly low preference (2), incompatible with schedule
- **Sweet Spot**: Considered as alternative, but athlete preferred intensity over duration

### Race-Specific Preparation

| Race Demand | How Plan Addresses It |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 75 miles / 4.5 hours | Long rides build to 3+ hours by Peak phase |
| 5,500ft elevation gain | Threshold and climbing intervals (standing climbs, over-unders) |
| Altitude (6,732ft) | Heat acclimation protocol weeks 12-16 helps with altitude adaptation |
| Technical gravel | Skills work included in long ride descriptions |
| Variable weather | Indoor/outdoor flexibility built into every workout |

### Health & Injury Considerations

| Health Factor | Plan Accommodation |
|---------------|-------------------|
| L4/L5 herniation history | Mobility/stretching in every strength session; core stability emphasized |
| Gout (managed) | Hydration reminders; fueling guidance avoids triggers |
| 39 years old | Extra recovery built in; adaptation weeks every 3-4 weeks |
| Good sleep (7h) | Recovery capacity assumed normal |
| Moderate stress | No heroic volume; consistency over intensity |

### Equipment & Environment

| Input | Plan Usage |
|-------|------------|
| Smart trainer + power meter | All workouts have precise power targets |
| Wahoo ELEMNT Bolt | ZWO files compatible |
| TrainingPeaks primary | Workouts designed for TP upload |
| Bodyweight + yoga mat only | Strength sessions use bodyweight, no barbell/kettlebell required |
| Good outdoor access | Weekend long rides can be outdoor |
| Good indoor tolerance | Weekday sessions can all be indoor |

## 3. Phase Structure Justification

| Phase | Weeks | Why This Duration |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| BASE | 1-9 | 9 weeks to build aerobic foundation; athlete coming from "minimal" recent training |
| BUILD | 10-14 | 5 weeks race-specific intensity; compressed due to June 1 deadline |
| PEAK | 15 | 1 week highest load before taper |
| MAINTENANCE | 16-17 | 2 weeks per athlete request ("complete training by June 1") |
| TAPER | 18 | 1 week reduction |
| RACE | 19 | Race week - openers only |

**Critical Constraint:** Athlete specified "majority of training by June 1st" due to work schedule. This compressed Build/Peak into April-May and created Maintenance phase for June.

---

## 4. Weekly Structure Justification

| Day | Workout Type | Why |
|-----|--------------|-----|
| Monday | REST | Athlete requested; family time |
| Tuesday | Anaerobic/HIIT | Short, high-intensity; fits 60-min AM slot |
| Wednesday | Recovery | Active recovery between intensity days |
| Thursday | Threshold | Second intensity session; fits 60-min slot |
| Friday | Recovery | Pre-weekend easy spin |
| Saturday | Long Ride / FTP Test | Key day; up to 5 hours available |
| Sunday | Endurance / Key Session | Second key day; up to 5 hours available |

**Strength:** Tuesday + Wednesday (2x/week as requested)
- Placed on limited-availability days as 30-min sessions
- Foundation, Power Development, Cycling-Specific rotation

## 5. Anticipated Questions

### "Why so much intensity and not more base miles?"

With only 5 hours/week, traditional base building (lots of Z2) isn't feasible. Research shows HIIT can deliver equivalent or better aerobic adaptations in time-crunched athletes. Your 20+ years of MTB gives you an aerobic base - we're adding specificity, not starting from scratch.

### "Why does my June look so easy?"

You told us: "Job in June prevents extensive training." We front-loaded your build phase to finish by June 1. June is maintenance - enough to hold fitness, not so much that it interferes with work. You'll arrive at race day fresh, not fatigued.

### "Why only 1 week of taper?"

For a 75-mile event with your fitness level, 7-10 days is sufficient taper. Longer tapers (2+ weeks) are for multi-day stage races or athletes with massive training loads. You'll feel fresh by race day.

### "Why am I doing strength training during a cycling plan?"

Your back injury history makes core stability non-negotiable. Strong core = stable platform = more power transfer. The strength sessions also address your "intermediate" strength background and improve muscular endurance for 5,500ft of climbing.

### "Can I skip workouts if life gets in the way?"

Yes, but prioritize in this order:
1. Weekend key sessions (long ride, threshold)
2. Tuesday/Thursday intensity
3. Strength (2x is ideal, 1x is acceptable)
4. Wednesday/Friday recovery (truly optional)

Never skip rest days. Recovery is where adaptation happens.

### "Why are Kyle and Burk on different plans?"

You each have different constraints, FTP, experience, and goals. "Similar" doesn't mean identical. You'll have comparable overall structure, but details differ. Compare notes, don't copy workouts.

## 6. Success Metrics

By race day, you should:
- [ ] Have a tested (not estimated) FTP
- [ ] Complete 3+ hour rides without bonking
- [ ] Handle SBT GRVL terrain simulation efforts
- [ ] Execute race-pace fueling without GI issues
- [ ] Arrive rested, confident, and ready to compete

## 7. Risk Factors & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Back flares up | Mobility work in every strength session; scale back volume if needed |
| Overreach from HIIT | Recovery weeks built in; RPE monitoring emphasized |
| June work stress | Maintenance phase is low-demand by design |
| Altitude surprise | Heat acclimation helps; arrive 24-48h early if possible |
| New to racing | Mental training section in guide; race simulation workouts |
