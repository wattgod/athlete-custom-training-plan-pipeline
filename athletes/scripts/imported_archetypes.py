34 archetype types x 6 levels = 204 workout variations.

Each archetype uses one of two formats:
  Format A (simple intervals): primer + single IntervalsT block
    Keys: intervals (repeats, on_duration), on_power, off_power, off_duration
  Format B (segments): list of segment dicts for complex multi-block workouts
    Segment types: steady, intervals, freeride, ramp
