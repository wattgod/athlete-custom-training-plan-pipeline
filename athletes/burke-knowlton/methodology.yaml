selected_methodology: MAF / Low-HR (LT1)
methodology_id: maf
score: 75.0
reasons:
- Beginner to cycling - needs aerobic base building first
- Recovery capacity reduced - conservative approach needed
- GI issues improving but still managing - low stress training
- Endurance background from running - MAF builds on this
- No FTP data yet - heart rate based training appropriate
warnings:
- May feel too easy initially - trust the process
- Progress is slow but sustainable
configuration:
  methodology: MAF
  intensity_distribution:
    z1_z2: 1.0
    z3: 0.0
    z4_z5: 0.0
  strength_approach: functional_support
  key_workouts:
  - long_z2_endurance
  - easy_aerobic
  - recovery_ride
  progression_style: volume_first_then_intensity
  testing_frequency: monthly_maf_test
  hr_cap: 146  # 180 - age (34)
alternatives:
- name: Sweet Spot / Threshold
  score: 50.0
  key_reason: After 8-12 weeks of MAF, could transition
- name: HIIT-Focused
  score: 40.0
  key_reason: Too aggressive for beginner with recovery concerns
- name: Time-Crunched
  score: 45.0
  key_reason: Could work but MAF safer for aerobic base
selection_date: '2026-02-10'
confidence: high
confidence_note: MAF selected manually due to beginner status, recovery concerns, and
  GI issues. Builds aerobic foundation safely before adding intensity.
override_reason: Algorithm selected HIIT but warnings indicated mismatch. Beginner
  cyclists benefit from aerobic base building. Recovery issues + GI problems require
  conservative approach.
