  race_list: 'Gravel century, randonneuring 300-400km, winter fat bike events'
  success_metrics: 'Complete events without fading. Improve speed to stay off DNF cutoff. Better hydration and fueling to avoid metabolic blowup late in events.'
  obstacles: 'Getting older. Intermittent left knee problems (chondromalacia patella). Hip resurfacing 2020 set back fitness significantly. All riding is solo - no club or group. Overwhelming amount of training advice causes paralysis.'
  training_goals: 'Increase endurance and speed on gravel and road. Increase overall strength and flexibility.'
  goals_notes: 'Wants to trust the plan and spend mental energy on getting workouts done, not second-guessing every ride or recovery session.'
training_history:
  summary: "Extensive touring background since early 20s. Ridden across US multiple times 1988-2007. Randonneuring 2007-2014 (200-1200km brevets). Past 10 years gravel, 200km road events, week-long bike tours. Winter fat biking since 2018 including Tuscobia 160 and ITI 350. Zwift past few years. Long slow distance background from touring. Speed came from riding with faster rando riders and high intensity running pre-2020."
