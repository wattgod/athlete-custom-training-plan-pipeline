maintenance_weeks: 0
tier: POLARIZED
tier_rationale: 61-year-old with extensive endurance background (30+ years touring,
  randonneuring). 5-10 hours available per week. Recovering from orthopedic setbacks
  (knee chondromalacia, hip resurfacing 2020). Long slow distance background favors
  polarized approach with emphasis on aerobic base. Knee limitations require avoiding
  high-force standing efforts.
ability_level: Intermediate
ability_rationale: Decades of long-distance cycling experience including transcontinental
  tours, 200-1200km brevets, winter ultra events (Tuscobia 160, ITI 350). However,
  recent fitness setbacks from hip surgery 2020 and ongoing knee issues. Currently
  can complete 200km road events and 50-60mi gravel but fading in second half.
training_readiness: ready_to_start
readiness_notes: Managing knee condition (chondromalacia patella). Hip fully recovered
  from 2020 surgery. On BP and cholesterol medications - monitor heart rate during
  intensity. Family cardiac history requires conservative intensity progression.
constraints:
- Chondromalacia patella limits standing efforts - no stomping, mashing, or heavy
  axial loading
- Avoid leg extensions, lunges, stair machine in strength work
- Wed/Fri limited availability (spouse time) - not ideal for long days
- Solo training only - no group or club rides for external motivation
- Family history of heart problems - conservative with high intensity
- Monitor response to BP medications during hard efforts
periodization_notes: Long base building phase (25 weeks) given extensive endurance
  background and need to rebuild aerobic fitness post-2020 hip surgery. Polarized
  approach with emphasis on Z2 volume. Short 2-week taper. Key focus on fueling and
  hydration strategies to address late-event fade. August gravel century is intermediate
  goal building toward winter fat bike A-events.
equipment_ready: true
equipment_notes: Smart trainer with power meter (indoor only), HR monitor, GPS device.
  Full gym access for strength work.
training_partners: []
training_partner_notes: All riding is solo. Previously pushed harder on brevets when
  riding with others. May need structured accountability to replace external motivation.
race_demands:
  distance_miles: 100
  estimated_duration_hours: 7
  terrain: Gravel roads, varied terrain
  key_demands:
  - 6-8 hour endurance capacity
  - Consistent pacing to avoid fade
  - Fueling and hydration execution
  - Knee-friendly power delivery (seated, spinning)
